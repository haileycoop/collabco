DESCRIPTION
-----------

Collabco is a simple kickstart for collaborative communities. Built on Drupal the platform is designed to deploy a bespoke collection of features which make it easier for individuals and organisations to work collaboratively and more successfully.

Collabco provides a a digital ‘nervous system’ platform combining networked knowledge and smart tools to overcome barriers to effective collaboration. 

As technology choices are fundamentally linked to and can evolve with the specific needs and interests of the user groups across business, government and research communities, Collabco is designed to provide a scalable and modular architecture allowing administrators to customise and enable or disable feature components (I.E Blog Spaces, Knowledge Objects, Profiles and Communication Tools) for use within an specific project.
